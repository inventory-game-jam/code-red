# Code Red

Code Red is a Minecraft minigame, played by 8 teams of 4.
There are two teams facing each other in each match. The defenders vs attackers.
The defenders will spawn in front of the **main objective**, and the attackers
will spawn on the other side of the map, spread out a bit.

There are buildings across the map which may contain generated loot.

The defenders will need to find a certain set of loot items which then needs
to be brought to their **team vault**. The team vault contains all the items
they need to find. Once all the items have been found, everyone gets alerted
and it is now **Code YELLOW**. The attackers will now have time to destroy
the main objective. The defenders will have to craft something out of the
loot items whilst defending the main objective from the attackers. If the
attackers destroy the main objective before the defenders have finished
crafting, it is **Code RED** and the attackers win the match. If the defenders
finish before the attackers, it is **Code GREEN** and the defenders win.
